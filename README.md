# Enhancing Certified Robustness via Block Reflector Orthogonal Layers and Logit Annealing Loss



## üöÇ Overview

Official PyTorch implementation for our ICML 2025 spotlight paper. We introduce:

- **Block Reflector Orthogonal Layer (BRO):** A low-rank, approximation-free orthogonal convolutional layer designed to efficiently construct Lipschitz neural networks, improving both stability and expressiveness.
- **Logit Annealing Loss (LA):** An adaptive loss function that dynamically balances classification margins across samples, leading to enhanced certified robustness.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- `bronet/` ‚Äî Contains the implementation for BRONet experiments.
- `lipconvnet/` ‚Äî Contains the implementation for the LipConvNet experiments.

Key modules:

- **BRO layer:** [`lipconvnet/models/layers/bro.py`](./lipconvnet/models/layers/bro.py)
- **LA loss:** [`bronet/models/margin_layer.py`](./bronet/models/margin_layer.py)

## üöÄ Getting Started

To set up the environment and run our code:

### 1. Requirements

- Python 3.11
- PyTorch ‚â• 2.0 with CUDA support
- A recent NVIDIA GPU (e.g., Ampere or newer) is recommended for training and certification

### 2. Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ntuaislab/BRONet.git
cd BRONet
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Reproduce the paper results

To reproduce the main results in the paper, run the following command:

```bash
cd bronet
bash run.sh
```

To test the provided models, download the checkpoint and config file, then run:

```bash
cd bronet
python test.py --resume_from="path_to_downloaded_checkpoint" --config="path_to_config"
```

See [`bronet/README.md`](./bronet/README.md) for instructions on reproducing the results.
